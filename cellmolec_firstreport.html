The hunchback (hb) gene is present in the early Drosophila embryo,
and Hunchback mRNA can be found originating from two sources;
maternal mRNA, inherited from the zygote&rsquo;s mother and present
in the egg at fertilization, and zygotic mRNA which is transcribed
from the zygote&rsquo;s own genome. In the early embryo, the maternal
hb mRNA is distributed equally across the embryo from anterior to
posterior.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times New Roman PSMT, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">When
the gene bicoid is transcriptionally activated in the zygote, this
activates the transcription of zygotic Hunchback mRNA. The bicoid
mRNA is located at the anterior end of the fertilized egg, and forms
a gradient with the level of bicoid protein decreasing toward the
posterior pole of the cell. Due to the gradient of bicoid
concentration, there is a corresponding gradient of protein made from
zygotic Hunchback mRNA, with Hunchback protein concentration being
highest at the anterior of the cell and decreasing towards the
posterior.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times New Roman PSMT, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
mRNA for another gene, nanos, is highest at the posterior of the
cell. Nanos protein forms a gradient across the cell similar to that
of bicoid, but running in the opposite direction; nanos concentration
is highest at the posterior of the cell, and decreases toward the
anterior end. Nanos acts as a translational repressor of the
Hunchback mRNA. The presence of Nanos establishes a gradient of
maternal Hunchback mRNA across the embryo, with the highest
concentration being found at the anteriorend, and decreasing toward
the posterior. This gradient of Hunchback protein is further enhanced
by the action of bicoid activating zygotic Hunchback mRNA
transcription, as described above.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times New Roman PSMT, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">In
the staufenmutant, the normal gradient of bicoid is disrupted; there
is some bicoid mRNA at the posterior of the oocyte, where it should
not be, and there is some drift of bicoid mRNA into the middle of the
cell. In this mutant, we might expect the gradient of Hunchback mRNA
to be disrupted by these changes. Since bicoid activates zygotic
Hunchback mRNA, we could expect to see more Hunchback mRNA being
produced at the posterior end of the oocyte, where it is not normally
found. Instead of a smooth gradient from anterior to posterior, we
might see high levelsof Hunchback mRNA and protein at both the
anterior and posterior poles, and slightly less in the middle of the
oocyte.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

The gene &quot;even skipped&quot; (eve) is an important segmentation
gene and illustrates some important concepts of enhancers, their
regulatory proteins, and how they function in the embryo. Eve forms a
pattern of expression that forms a segmentation pattern of seven
stripes in the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. In addition,
eve is expressed in the central nervous system, the mesoderm, and the
anal pad, each at different times during development. This is an
example of how gene expression can have a spatial and temporal
pattern of control.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times New Roman PSMT, serif"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
eve gene locus contains multiple enhancers which control its
expression in different locations at different times during
development. In order to identify when and where a particular
enhancer activated gene expression in the embryo, an experiment was
devised where each enhancer was paired with the reporter gene lac Z.
To clarify, only one enhancer at a time would be paired with the
reporter gene, in order to isolate its action. When this hybrid gene
was introduced into a Drosophila embryo, the lac Z reporter gene
would cause beta galactosidase to be made in the region controlled by
the enhancer it was linked to. By using X-gal to stain sections of
the embryo, researchers could determine where in the embryo the
enhancer was driving expression of the reporter gene. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
